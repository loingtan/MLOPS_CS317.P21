# MLOps Lab 3 Project Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of Lab 3, which adds comprehensive monitoring and logging capabilities to the Weather Prediction API developed in Lab 2. The implementation has been thoroughly tested and fixed to ensure all components work correctly together.

## Requirements Met

### System Resource Monitoring
- ✅ CPU usage monitoring via Node Exporter and custom metrics
- ⭐ GPU monitoring support (optional, implementation ready for NVIDIA GPUs)
- ✅ RAM usage monitoring via Node Exporter and custom metrics
- ✅ Disk space and I/O monitoring
- ✅ Network I/O monitoring (bytes transmitted and received)

### API Monitoring
- ✅ Request per second metrics via Prometheus
- ✅ Error rate tracking and alerting
- ✅ Response latency monitoring with histograms

### Model Monitoring
- ✅ Inference speed timing (CPU time)
- ✅ Confidence score tracking with histogram buckets

### Logging Service
- ✅ System logs (syslog) capture
- ✅ Application stdout capture
- ✅ Application stderr capture (error tracebacks)
- ✅ Application-specific log file monitoring

### Alerting Service
- ✅ High error rate detection (>50%)
- ✅ Low confidence score alerts (<0.6)
- ✅ System resource alerts (CPU, memory, disk)
- ✅ Email notification configuration
- ✅ Support for additional notification channels (Slack/Telegram examples)

## Architecture

The monitoring and logging solution follows a modern microservices architecture:

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐
│ Flask App   │────▶│ Prometheus   │────▶│ Grafana      │
│ with metrics│     │ (metrics DB) │     │ (dashboards) │
└─────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └──────────────┘
      │                     │
      │                     ▼

│ (logs)    │       │ (alerts)     │
└───────────┘       └──────────────┘
```

## Testing and Validation

Multiple test scenarios validate the implementation:
- Normal operation with varied prediction inputs
- Error scenarios with deliberately invalid data
- Load testing with rapid requests
- Alert triggering through error simulation

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for future iterations:
1. GPU monitoring implementation
2. Distributed tracing integration
3. Enhanced log analytics
4. Predictive alerting based on trends
5. CI/CD pipeline integration

## Conclusion

Lab 3 successfully implements a comprehensive monitoring and logging system that meets all the requirements. The system provides visibility into system resources, API performance, and model behavior, while also providing alerting capabilities for critical issues.

The modular architecture makes it easy to extend and customize the system for specific needs in the future.
